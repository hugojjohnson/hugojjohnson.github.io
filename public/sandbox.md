# Summary
Everyone needs a personal website: It's what puts you into the world, promotes you, and shows everyone what you're passionate about. For programmers especially, it's practically a no-brainer. For this reason, this website was one of the first ones that I made, but over time I've gradually added to it as I learned new skills.

<br />

I decided to put some of my projects up here so that a) you (the reader ðŸ™ƒ) can see what I've been working on, and b) so that I have some record of all the cool things I've made and when. I plan on adding new awesome things, so if you're not as pumped as I am, check back in a couple of months :)

# What I learned
## KISS
I always wanted to put on display the projects that I've been working on in my website. Originally, I was going to make a Rest API backend which would host a database of all the projects I've ever worked on, write some sort of keyword search engine for searching through them, and connect *that* to a GPT-powered recommendation algorithm-type-thing. It definitely would have displayed my skills. But it also would have been less reliable, more expensive, and more difficult to maintain.

<br />

Instead, this website is built solely in React, with each project post hard-coded into it. Whenever I add a project, I just edit the website and re-deploy it. And that's mean I had more time to work on other, more interesting projects (like <a target="_blank" href="https://hugojjohnson.github.com/workaholic">this one</a>).
